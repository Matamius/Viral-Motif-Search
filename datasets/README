How to understand REGEX in datasets:
.             Any amino acid 
[..]          Only amino acids listed are allowed
[^.]          These amino acids are not allowed
{min, max}    min to max number of amino acids allowed in sequence
^             match amino terminal (at start)
$             match carboxy terminal (at end)
?             one amino acid allowed (optional)
*             any number of amino acids allowed (optional)
+             one amino acid is allowed, optionally more
|             either expression is allowed
(...)         Marks positions of interest or is used to group parts of expression
