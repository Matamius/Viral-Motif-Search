This project is a simplistic web-based project that is designed to assess some viral gene vector
We are assuming that this viral vector is unknown, but for testing and demonstration purposes it will use known genes.
The program will:
  take in a FASTA formatted gene sequence,
  convert the gene into 6 reading frames and generate a list of peptides per frame,
  these peptides will be compared against a database of motifs to produce a set of results depicting similarity to motif structure,
  present the user with a table of peptides, the motif structure it is similar to, and associations to the motif structure.

The idea is to assess any potential parts of the gene that may produce peptides that are similar to short linear motifs, structural motifs, or repeated residues.
The database will need to be curated, but the idea is a WIP based on some papers:
  Sobhy H. (2016). A Review of Functional Motifs Utilized by Viruses. Proteomes, 4(1), 3. https://doi.org/10.3390/proteomes4010003.
  Hraber, P., O'Maille, P. E., Silberfarb, A., Davis-Anderson, K., Generous, N., McMahon, B. H., & Fair, J. M. (2020). Resources to Discover and Use Short Linear Motifs in Viral Proteins. Trends in biotechnology, 38(1), 113â€“127. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2019.07.004
These research papers have a small but detailed list of motifs associated with virulence and will need to have a spreadsheet designed in accordance to the data presented.
Supplemental data will be added onto the spreadsheet as I find them.
  
Following Hraber, et al., I came across the ELM database with a curated tsv file of viral class motifs. I will convert the file database to csv.
Furthermore, I have converted the database from Sobhy's Table 1 into a csv file as well. All REGEX patterns will be converted such that they follow a consensus.
